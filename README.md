# Giphy Playground

## Getting Started

### Technologies needed to run this project

- Node 16.14.2 or later
- yarn

### Installing dependencies

### Giphy API Key

In order to run this application you need to create a Giphy account and generate an API Key, I really suggest to follow
this guide [Giphy Quick-Start](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide). After that you would need to
create a `.env` file following the `.env.example` that we have in the project and paste your key in the file

```shell
  yarn start
